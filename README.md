# SS2023-KI1
This is the repository for the exercise lecture of the module "Smart Computing"/"Grundlagen der KÃ¼nstlichen Intelligenz" at the University of Rostock. 
There are two ways to execute the material:
1. Download and execute everything locally on your own laptop.
2. Execute the material with Binder. 

For the first variant there are the following requirements:
1. Python and the required packages installed
2. Jupyter notebook/lab installed

We would recommend to install all of the above mentioned software via Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/). 

Additionally, you can execute the whole repository via Binder (without installing anything): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/turing-tester95/SS2022-KI1/HEAD)
